 <strong>Protecting the Environment:</strong><br/> When we reduce waste, we help protect the environment. Less waste means less pollution, less landfill space used, and less energy consumed in the production and disposal of goods.</p>

 <p className="text-primary dark:text-secondary opacity-75 md:pr-10 my-6 md:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-center">
 <strong>Conserving Resource:</strong><br/> Many materials used in schools come from limited natural resources. By reducing waste, we can conserve resources like paper, water, and energy, ensuring they are available for future generations.</p>

 <p className="text-primary dark:text-secondary opacity-75 md:pr-10 my-6 md:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-center">
 <strong>Saving Money:</strong><br/> Waste reduction can lead to cost savings for schools. By reusing materials, implementing recycling programs, and practicing efficient resource management, schools can reduce their expenses on purchasing new supplies.</p>

 <p className="text-primary dark:text-secondary opacity-75 md:pr-10 my-6 md:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-center">
 <strong>Teaching Responsibility:</strong><br/> By promoting waste reduction, we teach students the importance of responsible consumption and the impact of their actions on the environment. It helps instill habits of sustainability and encourages them to become environmentally conscious citizens.</p>

 <p className="text-primary dark:text-secondary opacity-75 md:pr-10 my-6 md:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-center">
 <strong>Setting an Example:</strong><br/> Schools play a vital role in shaping students' behavior and attitudes. By prioritizing waste reduction, schools set an example for students, families, and the community, inspiring them to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.</p>
